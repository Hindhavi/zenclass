why new tags in html5?
the new tags are introduced to define semantic/structural elements,text-formatting instructions, form controls, input types, and etc.

The difference between html elements and tags are, html represents the document structure where as, tags are simply a part 
html syntax.a simple html is made of an opening tag and closing tag and some contents. 
In case of element nesting, an html element can also contain other elements which are then called nested elements.

the tags should be open with angle brackets and close with /
for example:
<html>
<head>
<body>
<script>
</script>
</body>
</head>
</html>

the tags should open and close in a correct manner.
<area>	<base>	<br>	<col>	<embed>
<hr>	<img>	<input>	<keygen>	<link>
<meta>	<param>	<source>	<track>	<wbr>
 
these are some of the new tags in html5.
