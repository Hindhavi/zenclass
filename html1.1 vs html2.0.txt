2.http 1.1 requires 3 TCP for sending request.


HTTP 2.0:

3.page load speed improvements.
4.compression of request headers.
5.HOL(head of line) blocking-package blocking
6.request pipelining
7.http 2.0 can send multiple request for data in parallel over a single TCP.
8.Less prone to errors.
9.lighter network footprint.
10.effective network resource utilization.
11.compact representation of commands or easier processing and implementation.
